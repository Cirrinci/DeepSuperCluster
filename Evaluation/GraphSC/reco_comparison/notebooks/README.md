# Reconstruction performance evaluation

The notebooks in this folder are used to evaluate the performance of the final CMSSW reconstruction and to compare the
electrons and photons energy resolution between Mustache and DeepSC superclusters. 

The script [plotting_code.py](./plotting_code.py) contains the basic code for the final performance plots. 

An example with the evaluation of the final resolution can be found in the notebooks:

- Electrons: [Plotting_RecoRegression_electron.ipynb](./Plotting_RecoRegression_electron.ipynb)
- Photons: [Plotting_RecoRegression_electron.ipynb](./Plotting_RecoRegression_electron.ipynb). 

These notebooks have been used to produce the results approved for ICHEP2022. 

## Debugging notebooks

All the other notebooks have been used for investigation and debugging.
