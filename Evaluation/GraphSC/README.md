# Reconstruction result evaluation


## Training validation
Once the training is done, the performance on the testing dataset is analyzed quickly in jupyter notebooks, before applying the model in CMSSW reconstruction. 

The folder [training_validation](./training_validation/) contains many notebooks used to evaluate quickly the performance of a trained model.

## Reconstruction performance analysis
The model is then applied in the CMSSW reconstruction and the final performance can be analyzed thoughtfully.  
To performe a detailed reconstruction analysis have a look at the instructions in the folders [reco_comparison](./reco_comparison/).
